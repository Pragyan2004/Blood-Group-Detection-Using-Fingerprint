# Fingerprint-Based Blood Group Prediction

# Introduction:

This repository contains the code for a simple web application that attempts to predict blood group based on fingerprint data.  The project utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier) and a Flask web framework.  This project is intended solely for educational purposes to illustrate the process of building a web application that interacts with a machine learning model.

# Requirements:

* Python
* Flask
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Pickle

# Dataset:-
         https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajumavinmar/finger-print-based-blood-group-dataset/data

# Features:

* Web-based interface for inputting fingerprint features.
* Pre-trained machine learning model for prediction.
* Display of predicted blood group (for demonstration purposes only).
* Error handling for invalid input.
* Model persistence using pickle for efficient loading.
* Feature scaling using StandardScaler to improve model performance.


# Run the Flask app
